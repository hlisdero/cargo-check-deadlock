//! Representation of a MIR function in the Petri net.
//! For an introduction to MIR see:
//! <https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html>
//!
//! The `MirFunction` stores a vector of `BasicBlock` which are connected between them through
//! different terminator statements such as goto, switch int, call, unwind, assert, drop, etc.
//! The `MirFunction` keeps track of an active block, the one currently being translated.
//! The operations are performed mostly on this block.
//!
//! The basic blocks are indexed by the type `rustc_middle::mir::BasicBlock` in the representation of the body.
//! <https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Body.html>
//! The order in which the blocks get visited during the translation is linear.
//! But the terminators may refer to blocks previously seen or new blocks. Each basic block is visited only once.
