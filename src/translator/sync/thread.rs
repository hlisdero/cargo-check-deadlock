//! Representation of a thread to be translated later.
//!
//! The thread involves a translation subprocess that connects
//! to the main Petri net in two places:
//! - The start place i.e, when `std::thread::spawn` is called.
//! - The end place i.e, when `std::thread::JoinHandle::<T>::join` is called.
//!
//! The thread starts after the call to `std::thread::spawn`.
//! The transition that represents this function call produces a second token
//! and places it in the new thread's start place.
//! This token models the execution flow of the new thread.
//!
//! The thread end place is connected to the transition that models
//! the call to `std::thread::JoinHandle::<T>::join`.
//!
//! The Petri net for the new thread "spans" between the two transitions.
//! We cannot connect this net to the net of the spawning thread until the
//! call to `std::thread::JoinHandle::<T>::join` is translated.
//! Therefore we store the basic information we need
//! to translate the thread function and defer the translation.
//! The function executed by the thread is translated to a Petri net just as any other.
